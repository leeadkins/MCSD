== Sakura CMS v1.1

The Marion County Sheriff's Department webpage is based on a simple Rails-based CMS called Sakura. For now, Sakura isn't in a state to be extracted as a general purpose CMS, so if you want to use it, you'll need to modify this existing site. In the future, Sakura will be its own full-fledged Rails application.


== Installation

To use this application, you'll need to first provide two files:

config/database.yml
db/seeds.rb

In seeds.rb, you need to create your first admin user.  To do, create the file with a line like this

user = User.create(:username => "admin", :password => "admin", :password_confirmation => "admin", :email => "email@domain.com", :roles => [:admin] )

Alternatively, you could create this value in the console instead of providing a seed file.

Once deployed to your server, simply run your migrations:

rake db:migrate

and you'll be ready to go.  For now, all required gems are vendored.  If you wish to use your own gem versions, just remove the appropriate folder in the vendor folder. These gems are:

authlogic, bitmask-attribute, declarative_authorization, paperclip

nokogiri is used for screen scraping. It is also a framework gem that depends on some external extensions, so it isn't frozen into the vendor directory.
If you wish to use the rake tasks for automatically loading the Sex Offender registry, ensure that you run rake gems:install or gem install nokogiri before installing this app.

In the future, these will be unvendored.


That's it!  On your dev machine, run script/server, or if you've deployed it, point Passenger or your mongrels to the appropriate path.

== Usage

You can access the administration panel at http://rooturl/admin.

Use any of the links in the dashboard to add the type of content listed. Much of it is specialized to the MCSD installation, but some areas of interest will be Pages, Posts, Users, and Images.

Pages : Create content pages (CMS style).  Tip: On the Pages List view, you can drag the items to reorder them in public facing site menu.

Posts: Create news posts (Blog style). Tip: Slugs is optional, and can be automatically created if you leave the field blank. 

Users: Create new users. There are many roles that a user may have. Check out the User.rb model and the authorization_rules.rb config file to see what they are.

Images: Create and manage image assets for use in Posts or Pages.  These assets can be used directly or accessed via the Image Browser on the Create Posts and Create Pages sections.

=== URL Mapping
There are two main types of general content that can be added to Sakura: pages and posts. By default, pages are mapped to the root url using their provide slugs. If you provide the slug "main" to a page, it will map to:
http://root/menu

News posts are mapped to /posts/#{id}-#{slug}, so the first post on the system with a slug of welcome-home would map to:
http://root/posts/1-welcome-home

Certain "reserve paths" are mapped to urls. These include things like "admin", and in the case of MCSD, "most-wanted".
The result of this is that any pages that use a reserved path will not be accessible. To remedy this, you'll need to either change the slug of your page or change the URL of the named route in the Routes file. It'll probably be easier to just change your slug.
